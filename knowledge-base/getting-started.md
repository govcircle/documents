# getting-started

This guide provides the necessary steps to authenticate and begin using the GovCircle platform. As an advanced governance participant (DRep, CC Member, or SPO), you will gain immediate access to tools that enhance accountability, constitutional analysis, and communication.

### <mark style="color:$primary;">1. Authentication and Wallet Connection</mark>

GovCircle uses secure, non-custodial wallet connections to verify your identity and delegated governance rights.

* Step 1: Wallet Selection. Connect a Cardano-compatible wallet (e.g., Lace, Eternl, Typhon) that holds the keys associated with your registered D-Rep, CC, or SPO governance key.
* Step 2: Signature Request. The platform will prompt a signature request. This is a non-monetary transaction used _only_ for proving ownership of your governance keys. Approve the signature request in your wallet.
* Step 3: Role Recognition. Upon successful signature verification, GovCircle will automatically detect your role (DRep, CC, or SPO) and grant you the appropriate access permissions (e.g., access to the Action Checker for CC members).

### <mark style="color:$primary;">2. Setting Up Your Governance Profile</mark>

Your profile is essential for building trust and facilitating the off-chain communication managed by the Circle Module.

* Action: Navigate to the Governance Overview section.
* Required Fields: Complete your profile with the following information:
  * Self-Introduction: A brief statement outlining your governance philosophy and priorities.
  * Direct Channel Link: Provide the URL or handle for your preferred communication channel (e.g., Discord server, X/Twitter handle) where constituents can reach you. This link populates your Direct Channel in the Circle Module.
  * Delegation Rationale (Optional): If applicable, provide a rationale for why delegators should choose your key.

### <mark style="color:$primary;">3. Immediate Priorities for New Users</mark>

Once authenticated, your immediate focus should be on familiarizing yourself with the core analytical and communication tools.

### Reviewing the Constitution

Familiarize yourself with the current framework using the structured interface:

* Task: Navigate to Modules > Constitution Module.
* Goal: Use the Hierarchical Display to quickly navigate to the most recent official rules. Understand the current Validity Score for the most contentious sections.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Monitoring New Issues

Begin monitoring the community's most pressing concerns:

* Task: Navigate to Modules > Circle Module.
* Goal: Review the List of Signals and begin prioritizing issues. Use the integrated tools to provide a quick Like/Dislike vote on the Signal of Issue submissions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Engaging in Dialogue

Establish early communication to fulfill your role's responsibilities:

* Task: Use your Direct Channel link in your profile to initiate a discussion on a newly prioritized Signal of Issue. Use the Event Manager integration (accessible via the Circle Module) to log your discussions.
